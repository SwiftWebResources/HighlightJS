# HighlightJS-Swift

This repo contains
[Highlight.js](https://highlightjs.org)
packaged up as Swift Package Manager project.

Since the Swift Package Manager cannot yet deal with resource files,
this is a more convenient way to directly embed common resources
within your application.
It is pretty big though :-)
